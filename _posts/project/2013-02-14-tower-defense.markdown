####Modelling NPC Behavior of Tower Defense Game.
Tower Defense genre is one of type Real Time Strategy games. Tower Defense games have two objects (NPC) that’s called Enemy in charge of attacking the player’s Defense and Tower that serves to block the Enemy. In making of Real Time Strategy game, one of the reasons that affect user’s interest in playing this game is it’s NPCs. Therefore, there are several things to consider in building and designing process of the NPC in the game Tower Defense. The design of this research includes the analysis of gameplay NPC, NPC identification, NPC behavior identification, and designing implementation Artificial Intelligence for NPC. Behaviour implementation on Enemy NPC using A star pathfinding, so Enemy can find the shortest path that is passed to reach the end point. At the Tower behaviour, for chasing behaviour using Line of Sight techniques and for state machine behaviour using Finite State Machine for Tower seeking Enemies within its range and to improve the capability and strength of Tower. Testing frame rate and memory usage required in 10 trials at 2 scenarios, prove that the NPCs has been run in accordance with the design optimally. This research will providing guidance to beginner game developers how to build games Tower Defense NPC in the mobile game.
