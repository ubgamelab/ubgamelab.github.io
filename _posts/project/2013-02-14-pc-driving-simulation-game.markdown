####3D PC Driving Simulation Game.
Traffic signs and traffic regulation is a subject that needs to be learned. During this time, people had to learn by read and memorize the traffic signs and not all traffic signs they could find in the real world. Based on these problems, it needs a media that can give fun learning and provide such as realistic experiences. 3D Driving Simulation is a game that aimed to introduce and educate traffic sign and traffic regulation of Indonesia. At the design stage, the requirements of the game development arranged in game design and technical design. Then the game is implemented using the JAVA programming language and jMonkeyEngine SDK IDE. At unit testing, it was concluded that the unit module of the program meet the functional requirements that have been designed at the design stage. At integration testing, it was concluded that the integration of some modules of the program unit meets the functional requirements that have been designed at the design stage. In the validation testing performed on the 10 computer systems, only 6 computer systems can do all the game functions properly. In the performance testing, it can be determined the minimum system requirements to play the game. The playtesting results that the game can provide traffic learning and satisfaction for the player.
