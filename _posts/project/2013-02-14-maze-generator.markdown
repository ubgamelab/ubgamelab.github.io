####Maze Generator using Eller Algorithm in “Lost In Maze” The Game
Making pathway is essential to form a maze . But the more maze made it even longer preparation time . Then to make pathway need of a maze generator that can generate automatically so that there be diverse pathways and the degree of difficulty becomes different. The resulting maze is a maze that must be resolved is the maze that has a path from the entrance to the exit. Eller algorithm is one of algorithms to make the Maze . Eller algorithm makes the maze one row each time , and when the maze has been established then the algorithm does not return to the previous row . Eller 's Algorithm makes the maze by creating pathways for cells in each row . When a row has been formed and will be made from row to row next lane . In testing the algorithm implementation Eller for the maze generator on Game Lost in Maze succeed 100 % shaping the maze . Eller algorithm implementation for the maze generator on game “Lost in Maze” can be formed quickly , visible from the maze measuring 100 x 100 grid size just took 33 milliseconds . The greater grid of maze more memory is needed. Lowest memory enhancement seen an increase of 0,18 MB and 1,9 MB of memory is the biggest. The average increase in memory is 1,038 MB.
