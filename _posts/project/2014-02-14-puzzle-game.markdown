####The Development of Puzzle Game to Comprehend Flowchart Algorithm Process.
The algorithm is a word that is familiar to the informatics and computer science students. Function of algorithm is as a foundation to resolve a problem in a structured, effective, and efficient. But in practice, informatics / computer science students is still difficulty to understand the workings of algorithm. Therefore, made puzzle game to help understanding the workings of algorithm. The design of this game is expected to help informatics / computer science students, especially new students to understand the steps in algorithm. The algorithm is represented in the form of a flowchart that has been modified in order to attract students to learn and understand the algorithms.
The design of this educational game created by stage game concept design and technical design. Game design implementation using the C# programming language. For the object of making games using CorelDRAW X4 and Unity 4. These games can be applied to the Windows PC platform. This application testing using White-Box Testing that includes the unit testing and integration testing. User testing is done by distributing questionnaires to the respondent informatics / computer science students. From the test results it was concluded that this game has met the functional and non-functional requirements.
