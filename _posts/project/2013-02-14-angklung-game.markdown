Angklung is one of Sundanese local cultures in West Java. Many schools organize extracurricular activities to learn angklung instruments. But along with the lack of publicity on the community, lack of angklung instrument at school, and high prices of traditional musical instruments have become obstacles to learn it. Therefore, the author developes an angklung simulator game on smartphone with Android operating system. So simulator game  is expected to be a solution to overcome these problem. The game design phase consist of Game Design  and Technical Design then implemented and developed using AndEngine game engine based on Java, whereas for modeling the characters and the game environment using Corel Draw X5 and Adobe Photoshop CS4. AndEngine and android are used as libraries in game development. Game Testing on Simulator Angklung using white-box testing, black-box testing, and performance testing that use frame rate value analysis. Based on the results of unit testing and integration testing can be concluded that  unit game modules have fulfilled the functional requirements that have been designed at the design phase. In validation testing can be concluded that the implementation and functionality of the game Simulator Angklung have fulfilled the requirement that is described in the requirements analysis phase. The results of performance testing show that optimal performance is occurred when the game runs on smartphones with minimal processor is 600Mhz.
