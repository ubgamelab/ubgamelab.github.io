####3D Container Truck Simulation Game.
Vehicle Simulation is a game that simulate pilot/driving a vehicle. Truck operator is a man who drive the container transportation truck from the dock to the port terminal or vice versa. In carrying out the procedures for implementing, truck operators have some work instructions. Work instructions are operating procedures at the container terminal. Regulations made used to support and maintain the safety and discipline in order to minimize unexpected events in the area of container terminal. Therefore , it takes an alternative that can help provide an understanding and give more experience with describe as well as the introduction the rules and the environment in a media that is through a simulation game designed into a game entitled " Container Truck Simulation Games in 3D ". Methods and design of this game requires three phases there are observation, design and implementation. All three phases are necessary in completing this simulation game, by providing 3D modeling and regulations as in the actual environment. As a result from testing, ranging from the validity test , unit , integration , and performance, it can be concluded that this simulation game has fulfilled the functional and non functional requirements and produce the minimum specification hardware requirements to execute the game by taking the level of performance based FPS ( Frames per Second ).
