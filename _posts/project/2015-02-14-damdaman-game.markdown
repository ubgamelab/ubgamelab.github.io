####Implementation of Minimax Algorithm and MTD(f) Optimization in “Dam-Daman” Traditional Game
Dam-daman is traditional game from indonesia which played by two player alternately. The goal of this game is to spend enemy pieces. Dam-daman’s games genre is turn based strategy. Generally, turn based strategy use minimax as it’s Algorithm. But, minimax have some problem when implemented in higher recursive depth, minimax will run so slowly. Because minimax will visit every node has been generated one by one. So, it is need some optimation algorithm to boosting minimax. MTD(f) offers a solution with zero-window search method. MTD(f) give some low upperbound and lowerbound to AlphaBeta Method. The research goal is to implement and test MTD(f) performance to dam-daman games. Performance testing conducted to determine the effect of search depth and height of the board game against the expanded nodes and execution time MTD (f) the checkers game. Based on test results, Minimax algorithm MTD (f) has a reliable performance. Increasing the search depth and board games do not negatively affect the performance of computing.
