####3D Driving Exam Simulation Game.
Gobak sodor or Go Back to Door is one of traditional games that is started to be forgotten because of the technology expansion. Nowadays, children are more interested to play multimedia-based games or known as video games. Therefore, the author developed a 3D Gobak Sodor game to re-introduce the traditional game to the teenagers with hope Gobak Sodor is started to be known and played again. The design of the game consists of makin g Game Design and Technical Design that is implemented by using jMonkey Java based, whereas the model of characters and game environment used 3D Blender. On its development, the researcher used the library on this game that is already available on the jMonkey engine. The Gobak Sodor 3D game has been tested by software testing using white-box testing and performance testing through the frame rate analysis. Based on the test result, it can be conclude that the unit module of the game program has met the functional requirements that have been designed in drafting stage. In validation testing, it can be concluded that the implementation and functionality of Sodor Gobak 3D game is already required the needs in analysis phase. The results show the vary performance based on the specifications of the computer running the Gobak Sodor 3D game.
